        <h2 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInBottomRight">What is Foodpanda</h2>
       <p  class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUpBig">
We are a small team of problem solvers, 
designers, thinkers and tinkers,working
 around the clock to make Foodpanda the most
  powerful online tool for ordering food in the 
  universe. We believe that ordering food should
   be easy, fast and definitely fun! We wanted
    something simpler, so we made it.</p>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUpBig">
        In 2012, Swiss Lukas Nagel and Rico Wyder established Foodpanda in Singapore. They then expanded in Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand.[4][5]

        A year later in 2013, Foodpanda was launched in Bangladesh and Romania.[6][7] With more than 20,000 employees operating in their company, Foodpanda is currently the largest food delivery service in Bangladesh.[6]
        
        In 2014, the service expanded into the Balkans,[7] Brunei,[8] as well as the Philippines.[9] In February 2014, Foodpanda had acquired its main rival in Pakistan, Eat Oye.[10] Global expansion of the Foodpanda business was led by Ralf Wenzel, Felix Plog and Ben Bauer.[citation needed]
        
        In 2015, cofounder Rohit Chadda stepped down from roles at the company. By 2016, none of the original managing directors or cofounders were present with the company.[11] Its original operation in Indonesia had shut down due to competition with flourishing app-based taxi-motorbike services,[12] while the company sold its Delivery Club business in Russia to Mail.Ru for $100 million in November 2016.[13]
        
        Foodpanda's largest investor Rocket Internet sold the service to Delivery Hero in December 2016.[14][15] On 1 November 2017, Foodpanda re-branded and changed its color from orange to pink with updated logo across all served countries, following its acquisition by Delivery Hero.[16] It had gone through three management changes by 2019.[14]
        
        In April 2018 they left the Brunei market.[17]
        
        From 2019 to 2020, Foodpanda began operating in other markets in Southeast Asia, launching in Thailand, Myanmar,[18] Cambodia,[19] and Laos.[20] Foodpanda was also launched in Japan in September 2020.[21][22]

        In May 2021, Glovo acquired Foodpanda brand in Bulgaria and Romania.[23] In September 2021, Delivery Hero unified its subsidiary brand NetPincér with Foodpanda in Hungary, with NetPincér rebranding as Foodpanda.[24] In December 2021, Foodpanda stopped its food delivery services in all cities of Germany, except central Berlin.[25][26]
        
        In early 2022, Foodpanda announced its new mascot called Pau-Pau, an anthropomorphic panda that cares about empowerment and environment. The new mascot will be rolled out across all of Asia.[27]

    <h2  class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUpBig">Investments</h2>
    <p id="p_2"class="p_style">Foodpanda raised $20 million in initial funding from Investment AB Kinnevik, Phenomen Ventures and Rocket Internet in April 2013.[39][40] In September 2013, iMENA Holdings invested $8 million.[41] In February 2014, there was another funding round of $20 million from a group of investors, including Phenomen Ventures.[42] On 11 August 2014, the company announced that it has collected another $60 million in financing from a group of investors.[43] In March 2015, the company announced it has raised over $110 million from Rocket Internet, as well as other investors.[44] Less than two months later, a group of investors, including Goldman Sachs, invested over $100 million in Foodpanda.[45] In December 2016, Delivery Hero announced a full acquisition of Foodpanda for an undisclosed price.[4</p>
<h3 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUpBig">Controversies</h3>
<p class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUpBig">In August 2020, Thai pro-democracy protesters launched a boycott against Foodpanda after it was found among the advertisers on Nation TV, a pro-establishment mouthpiece. The boycott forced the company to suspend all of its advertisements on the channel over concerns about its reputation.[47]

    In July 2021, the company again suffered a widespread boycott in Thailand, after it tweeted that it would dismiss one of its drivers who was seen at the place where a royal portrait was set on fire during a pro-democracy protest on 18 July, saying his act breached its policy against "terrorism".[47][48] It was reported that around two million users in Thailand had deleted their accounts on the Foodpanda application overnight.[49][50] Many restaurants also joined the boycott, announcing their withdrawal from business partnership with Foodpanda.[51] The company later apologised, stating that it supports free speech and would not dismiss the driver.[48]
    
    In July 2021, the company experienced protests in the Philippines over allegedly unfair wage policies among its riders. Shortly before the protests started, at least 30 of its riders were reportedly suspended for 10 years.[52] The company later apologized for the suspensions, claiming that they happened due to technical glitches in their riders' software.[53]
    
    In October 2021, the company in Malaysia received backlash after several of its vendors claimed that the service charges them excessively high commission rates as well as other hidden fees. Some vendors have even gone ahead and terminated their accounts with the service after a revelation of a compilation of more than 70 screenshots of Facebook posts and pictures of invoices from foodpanda vendors who claim that they are being charged a hidden fee which results in a zero return of sales.[54]
    
    In November 2021, some Foodpanda workers in Hong Kong striked, denouncing exaggerated monthly income promises and other problems.[55]</p>
